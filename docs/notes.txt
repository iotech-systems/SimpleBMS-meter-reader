Notes about the workings of the system.

Problem 01:
   * addressing/identifying meter in database
   -> use edge device hostname/MAC + modbus address id
      -> hostname would come from /etc/hostname
      -> MAC from edge dive network card
      -> modbus address id would come directly from the meter
      -> modbus has addressing of 0 to 247 with 0 belonging to the master
      -> modbus address ids will be unique per edge device
   ----
   this way meters would automatically be identified and would make them
   trackable
