basic workings of the system:

   1. system will be composed of a number of meters attached to a modbus/rs485
   2. this modbus/rs485 will be connected to an edge-device at a ttyUSBx device
      like: /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyUSB1
   3. a process per ttyUSBx device will run
   4. process will have number of stream-threads running
   5. each stream-thread will run at a configurable interval
   6. stream-thread will read predefined registers in all the attached meters
   7. stream-thread will post those readings into a collecting device within LAN
